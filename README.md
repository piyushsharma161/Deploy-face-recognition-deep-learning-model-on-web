# Deploy-face-recognition-deep-learning-model-on-web
Deploy face recognition deep learning model on web

dataset folder has train and test pictures

collect_pics_for_train_test.ipynb is used to collect many pics using laptop cam within few seconds.

Deep-Learning-Face-Recognition has haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml used to extract faces from the pics.

train_model.ipynb is used to train the model and save it

recognition.ipynb is used to predict the faces.

Used flask to deploy the model.

Sample test case is attached how the model works.

To activate, need to run command "python app.py" on anaconda prompt.
